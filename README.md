# Variables

Variables are used to store the data. It is like a placeholder.

## Three types of Variables: 

1 - Local Variables

2 - Instance Variables

3 - Static variables


### Local Variables...

Local variables are variables declared inside the method or constructor or blocks.

We can access the local variables only inside the method, constructor or block.


## Instance Variable...

Instance Variables are declared inside the class.

We can access Instance variables with in the class. All methods that are in the class can also access the Instance variables.

The memory allocation of an Instance variable is when the object is created. To create the object we use the class name.

## Static Variable..

Static variables are declared inside the class. We use the static modifier to make the variable static.

We can access the static variable using the class name.

The memory alloctaion of a Static class is when the class is loaded.

## When to use Static variables and Instance variables

When the data is common to all objects we use the Static variable.

When the data is specific ( different ) to all objects we use the Instance variable.
